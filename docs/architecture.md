AIFENCE is one FastAPI application built by one factory. It owns the shared
foundation and then invites each installed subsystem to mount itself.

## Why a shared core rather than a single monolith

The tiers share their infrastructure — FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, pydantic,
cryptography, Prometheus — but their domain configuration and models are large
and distinct. The guard tier alone carries roughly 150 settings covering
signing, key management, artifact storage and worker behaviour.

`aifence.core` therefore owns only the cross-cutting infrastructure every tier
uses, while each subsystem keeps its own settings, models and routers. That
separation keeps the codebase maintainable instead of collapsing every option
into a single object.

## The composition seam

`aifence.subsystems` defines a `register(app, ctx)` protocol and discovers
installed subsystems in flow order (quality → guard → bus). `create_app` never
imports a subsystem directly, which means:

- subsystems can be added or replaced without changing the factory;
- the application runs with any subset installed;
- each subsystem mounts its own router, wires workers into the shared lifespan,
  and reads its own configuration.

`SubsystemContext` hands each subsystem the shared settings, engine and session
factory, so nothing builds a second connection pool.

## Mounted sub-applications

Guard and bus are mounted as FastAPI **sub-applications** at `/guard` and `/bus`
rather than having their routes spliced into the root app. They keep their
proven internals and their own router-level authentication, while sharing the
core engine, declarative `Base`, and metrics registry.

Two consequences follow, both handled explicitly:

**Lifespans must be bridged.** Starlette does not run a mounted application's
lifespan. Without intervention, each subsystem's HTTP clients, durable workers
and object-store clients would never start or be cleaned up. `create_app`
enters every mounted lifespan through an `AsyncExitStack`, so the whole fence
starts and shuts down as one unit.

**OpenAPI must be combined.** Sub-app paths would otherwise live only in
`/guard/openapi.json` and `/bus/openapi.json`. The factory folds them into the
single root document, re-basing paths under their mount and namespacing
component schemas to avoid collisions.

## Native routers

The quality tier, the [fence flow](fence-flow.md) and the
[operator console](operations.md#operator-console) are composed directly onto
the application rather than mounted. They therefore do **not** inherit guard's
router-level authentication, and `aifence.security` binds them to the same
identity explicitly. See [Security](security.md#one-identity-model).

## One database, one migration history

Every subsystem declares its models against `aifence.core.db.Base`, so a single
Alembic history builds the entire 66-table schema and one connection pool serves
every tier. A test asserts the committed migrations match the declared models,
so a subsystem cannot add a table without a migration.

PostgreSQL row-level security uses the `aifence` `set_config` namespace.

## Settings ownership

The composed application owns the settings the tiers must agree on —
environment, runtime role, log level, database URL, schema creation and docs —
and injects them into each subsystem. Without this, setting
`AIFENCE_ENVIRONMENT=production` would leave a subsystem on its own default and
silently skip its fail-closed validation. Tier-specific settings remain under
the `AIFENCE_GUARD_` and `AIFENCE_BUS_` prefixes.

## Data flow

1. **Quality** scores the artifact against the control registry and emits a
   quality decision.
2. **Guard** compiles the mandatory and tenant policy into an enforcement plan
   and issues an exact-action capability.
3. **Bus** durably persists the vetted payload as a claimable handoff, then
   optionally fans out to a broker.

Every step shares the request id, audit chain and telemetry established by the
core. See [Fence flow](fence-flow.md).
